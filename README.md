### Creative portion:

(1) We included timestamps on every comment and story that is posted, and this is displayed within the details of each story, and within the body of each comment. This was a change that we made within our tables, adding a timestamp column to the stories table and the comments table.

(2) We included a "your posts" section, which lists the stories that current user has posted. The user can click to open/edit that post from this section, as well as from the main listings. This section adds organization and ease for the user to find their stories, in case they would like to implement edits to the story. This section is only visible when users are logged in.

(3) We also created an admin account, who has the permissions to delete any stories/comments.

### Instructions for testing:
  Either use the pre-existing usernames (kripa, sally) with their corresponding passwords (kripa, sally), or create your own user. To test the admin feature, the username is "admin", and the password is also "admin".
